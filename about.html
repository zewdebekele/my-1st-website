          <p style="color: #f10486;"><b>My Journey into Tech:</b></p>
             "My fascination with technology began with a curiosity about how the digital world works.
              This curiosity led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at Mekelle 
              University's Ethiopian Institute of Technology (EIT-M), an institution renowned for its 
              rigorous curriculum and focus on innovation. Here, my theoretical knowledge is being solidly 
              built, but my true passion is ignited by the hands-on process of creation."
